## Automatic Neural Network Drift Detection

This repository contains a short research paper that investigates cheap frame filtering techniques to predict model drift in neural network models. This project was completed as part of UCLA's ML-driven Video Analytics Systems class in Winter 2020. The abstract is provided below.

### Abstract

> Widespread deployment of video cameras has fueled the growth in research into efficient video analytics systems. Many of these systems involve the use of specialized neural networks which are trained on the data coming from a specific video feed. One of the primary limitations of these systems is that the video feed can change, leaving the specialized model ill-equipped to make predictions. This paper proposes and motivates further research into systems that can cheaply track model drift and indicate when the specialized neural network needs to be retrained.
